NEdit 6.x (nedit-ng) is a Qt port of the Nirvana Editor (NEdit) version 5.6.

Because it is a true port of the original code, it (at least for now) inherits 
some (but not all) of the limitations of the original. On the other hand, some 
aspects have been improved simply by the fact that it is now a Qt application.

### Requirements:

Dependency                                  | Version Required
------------------------------------------- | ----------------
[Qt](http://www.qt.io/)                     | >= 5.5
[Boost](http://boost.org) (Headers Only)    | >= 1.35
[Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)| >= 3.0
[CMake](https://cmake.org)                  | >= 3.0

### Compiling:

	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ make
	
### Help Documentation

NEdit had extensive help texts, which have been carefully updated and made available 
online here: https://eteran.github.io/nedit-ng/

### Inherited Limitations:

* Text display is still ASCII only (for now).
* Regex engine is the original NEdit proprietary implementation. This was kept 
  for a few reasons:
    1. NEdit's syntax is **slightly** non-standard, and I wanted to keep 
       things backwards compatible for now.
    2. NEdit's syntax highligher has very carefully created regex's which 
       result in things being highlighted in a way that I (and I assume other 
       NEdit users) have grown to appreciate. A change in regex engine would
       likely require a rework on the syntax highlighting algorithm.
    3. The original highligher has some insider information of the regex
       implementation which it uses in order to be more efficient. I could 
       fake this information, but at the cost of efficiency.

### Improvements already available:

* Bug fixes! Yes, NEdit 5.6 unfortunately has some bugs, some of which can 
  result in a crash. Where possible, the new code has these fixed.
* Anti-aliased font rendering.
* Modern look and feel.
* Internally, counted strings are used instead of NUL terminated strings. This
  removes the need to have code that played games with substituting NUL 
  characters mid-stream.
* Use of some C++ containers means many internal size limits are no longer
  present.
* Code as been reworked using modern C++ techniques using a toolkit with an 
  active developer community, making it significantly easier for contributions
  to be made by the open source community.

Version 1.0's goal is to be a nearly 1:1 port of the original NEdit. Once that 
is complete some post 1.0 goals are already planned:

* Cross platform
* Internationalization!
* Python/LUA scripting support in addition to the built-in macro system
* An improved preferences system
* Extensibility though plugins
* Sessions, meaning that you can save and restore an edit session (such as 
  several open tabs)
